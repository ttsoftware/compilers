Introduction to the Group ASsignment

The goal of the group assignment is to implement a compiler for the Paladim language using a bottom-up grammar. The langauge we use for this implementation is Stanard ML.
The majority of the compiler has already been implemented, and the changes we made are described in the individual tasks below. 
The first two tasks of the assigment was completed as a milestone assignment. We have made slight changes since the milestone, which improves the work done in these two tasks. A full description of these tasks and all the changes we made, are also included here.
